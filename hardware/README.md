# Hardware #

This directory contains the hardware for PhyWhisperer-USB, including PCB and FPGA.

## PCB ##

The PCB data is provided in Altium Designer format (using AD19). In addition Gerber's are available in the output directory. You can get a free viewer for Altium Designer  if you wish to open the PCB files and don't use Altium Designer.

A PDF of the schematic is available in the docs sub-directory.

## FPGA ##

You can run the FPGA simulation as part of the regression testing. See details in [fpga/sim/README.md](fpga/sim/README.md)

See [fpga/hdl/README.md](fpga/hdl/README.md) for documentation of the FPGA architecture.
